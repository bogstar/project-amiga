Project Amiga is a prototype for a rogue-like card building game! The game features card and inventory management system, procedurally generated dungeons, 3D models and animation / sounds, and much more.

In this game your objective is to build the best card deck of all times. Dive into dungeons, conquer epic monsters, take their equipment, collect cards and defeat scary bosses!

The project was inspired by the games such as Hearthstone and Slay the Spire.
